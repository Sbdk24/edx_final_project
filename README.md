# edx_final_project
 This is my final project for CS50 python course

 Here I'd like document everything about the creation of this project, 
 from the thinking behind it until its implementation.

 So now, I'll describe the purpose of "Pearl Project" and 
 how it'll work behind the scenes.

 Pearl project (name it's likely to change), it's the final project I'm doing
 for CS50's python course. Here, I'd like to create something not only using my 
 new abilities using Python language but rather challenging myself to develop a 
 useful aplication for me and everyone that can be helped for this way to comunicate machines and humans.

 Pearl poject is thought as an "assintant-user" application to keep track of your tasks, getting you constantly noticed about your day-by-day responsabilities. This means that Pearl project is pursuing a constant interactuation with its owner.

 I'll start by scratch, creating core functionality of Pearl Project. 
 
 This'll be implemented full in Python language (by now, cause I can't use any other tool because of CS50's restriction) and the computer programming model is oriented object programming, it's better to have the tasks definded as template with its own sub-classes inside it, resulting as a more scalable project by the time new functionalities (after Final Project presentation) will've been made.

 Well, the real challenge in this program it's the way data wi'll be organized and how to recover it. Cause I'm not sure is a better idea to 
 store it into a server or just using lists and manage everything as dictionaries.

 Here's is an image of where was creataed classes, and the threes.
