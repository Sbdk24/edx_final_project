# edx_final_project
 This is my final project for CS50 python course

 Here I'd like document everything about the creation of this project, 
 from the the thinking behind it until its implementation.

 So now, I'll describe the purpose of "Pearl Project" and 
 how it'll work behind the scenes.

 Pearl project (name it's likely to change), it's the final project I'm doing
 for CS50's python course. Here, I'd like to create something not only using my 
 new abilities using Python language but rather challenging myself to develop a 
 useful aplication for me and everyone that can be helped for this way to comunicate machines and humans. 

 Pearl poject is thought as an "assintant-user" application to keep track of your tasks, getting you constantly noticed about your day-by-day responsabilities. This means that Pearl project is pursuing a constant interactuation with its owner.
